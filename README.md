# Airport Data Cleaning

In this data cleaning story, we will work with an airport dataset. It has 2,477 rows of data and 12 variables. We will clear some whitespace, try to fix date variable, play around with some categorical variables (changing case to upper, change the strings to categories, check for inconsistent values, and conduct a value count), check for duplicates, and finally tackle some outliers. So, let's get to it.
